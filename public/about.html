<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am passionate about my work.
   Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best.</br>
    In my last job, this passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that helped me to do better work.<br/>
     For example, I taught myself how to use Photoshop to improve the quality of our photos and graphics. <br/>
     I soon became the go-to person for any design needs.</p>

<p>I am ambitious and driven.
   I thrive on challenge and constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive towards. <br/>
   I am not comfortable with settling, and I am always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness.</br>
    In my previous role, I was promoted three times in less than two years</p>
